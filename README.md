# Challenge-8-Subway-Skate
 Subway Skate game is an android survival game using Unity 3D. This is the challenge 8 solution in the Maliyo GameUp Africa BootCamp 2022 Program. In this challenge, I Show off creative skills by enhancing gameplay features. Also, I improve the overall experience of the game by adding more UIs like settings and daily rewards. Finally, I Include the ability to change the main character (i.e giving the player the ability to use different characters for their run). The outcome include: 1. Learn how to polish a basic game and strengthen its core. 2. Learn how to integrate social interactions in a game. 3. Practice control of game objects with variables.
